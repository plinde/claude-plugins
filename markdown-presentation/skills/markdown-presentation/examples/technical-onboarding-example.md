# Example: Technical Infrastructure Onboarding

This example demonstrates a 15-minute technical onboarding presentation for a multi-layered infrastructure environment.

## Key Patterns Used

1. **Timing in Agenda** - Each section has explicit time allocation
2. **ASCII Architecture Diagram** - Visual overview that renders everywhere
3. **Tables for Quick Comparison** - Layers, components, responsibilities
4. **Expandable Details** - Command references, specifications, troubleshooting
5. **Quick Reference Card** - Takeaway summary at the end
6. **Horizontal Rules** - Visual slide breaks

## Template Extraction

The core structure can be reused for any technical onboarding:

```markdown
# [System Name]
## Team Onboarding Presentation

**Duration:** X minutes
**Audience:** [Target team]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
